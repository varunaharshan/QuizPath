# QuizPath

Grade 10/11 Science MCQ learning platform. See `docs/mvp-product-spec.md` for the full
product spec this build follows.

## Single-tenant MVP

This is a **single-tenant** application — one platform, one subject ("Science"), no
organizations/schools/tutors as first-class tenants yet. There is deliberately **no
row-level security, no `tenant_id`/`org_id` column, and no per-tenant scoping** anywhere in
the schema or query layer. Every authenticated student sees the same global content
(`subjects` → `modules` → `sub_topics` → `mcqs`). Don't add multi-tenant plumbing until
there's an actual second tenant to justify it.

That said, the schema is shaped so a future multi-tenant marketplace (multiple schools,
tutors publishing their own content, org-scoped rosters) can be layered on **without a
rewrite**:
- Content tables (`subjects`, `modules`, `sub_topics`, `content_items`, `mcqs`) are already
  separate from student/attempt data — adding an `org_id` or `owner_id` column to the
  content tables later is additive, not structural.
- `student_profiles` is already split from `users`, so a future `org_memberships` join
  table can sit alongside it without touching identity.
- IDs are UUIDs everywhere, so merging data across environments/tenants later doesn't hit
  collisions.
- `quiz_attempts` / `quiz_attempt_answers` / `mastery_scores` key off `student_id`, not off
  any tenant-scoped id, so per-tenant partitioning can be added via a join rather than a
  column rewrite.

## Stack choices

**Frontend + API: Next.js (App Router, TypeScript), API routes only — no separate backend
service.** For a single-tenant MVP with one developer and a 4-week timeline, running a
second service (NestJS/FastAPI) would mean a second deployment target, a second auth
integration, and CORS to manage, for no real benefit yet — everything the API needs
(Postgres access, Clerk session) is directly reachable from Next.js Route Handlers and
Server Components/Actions in the same process. Revisit this only if the API needs to be
consumed by something other than this web app (e.g. a mobile app) or needs to scale
independently of the frontend.

**Database: Postgres + Drizzle ORM** (not Prisma). Drizzle was the intended pick going in,
but it also turned out to be the pragmatic one in this environment: Prisma's CLI needs to
download a native query-engine binary on `postinstall`, and that download doesn't route
through this environment's egress proxy correctly (its `getProxyAgent` helper exists but
was never wired into the actual fetch call — a bug in the installed Prisma version — so
the download hits the network directly and gets reset). Drizzle is plain TypeScript over
`pg` with no native binary, so it isn't exposed to that problem, and for a schema this size
its lighter-weight, closer-to-SQL style is a good match anyway. Schema lives in
`src/db/schema.ts`, migrations/pushes run via `drizzle-kit` (see `package.json` `db:*`
scripts).

`src/db/index.ts` (the actual `pg` `Pool` + Drizzle client) is guarded with `import
"server-only"` so any accidental import from a Client Component or edge runtime fails at
build time with a clear message instead of a cryptic bundler error. `next.config.ts` also
marks `pg` as a `serverExternalPackages` entry — `pg` conditionally `require()`s optional
native bindings (`pg-native`, `pg-cloudflare`) that most installs don't have, and letting
Next's Turbopack dev bundler try to eagerly resolve those as external chunks is what causes
an `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` on a `pg-*` package; externalizing `pg` keeps it on plain Node
`require`, which already guards those with try/catch. Because `server-only` only no-ops
under the `"react-server"` export condition (how Next's own bundler marks genuine server
code), standalone scripts that import `@/db` outside of Next need that condition set
explicitly: `db:seed` runs via `cross-env NODE_OPTIONS=--conditions=react-server`, and
`vitest.config.ts` sets `resolve.conditions` / `ssr.resolve.externalConditions` to the same.

**Auth: Clerk**, Google as the only enabled social connection (configured in the Clerk
Dashboard, not in code — "add Facebook later" is a dashboard toggle, not new integration
work, which is the whole point of using a managed provider here). Session handling is via
`src/proxy.ts` (Next.js 16 renamed `middleware.ts` → `proxy.ts`; same mechanism) calling
`clerkMiddleware()` and protecting every route except `/` (the public landing page),
`/sign-in`, and the Clerk webhook. First-login provisioning happens two ways, both
idempotent on `users.auth_provider_id`:
1. Lazily, in `getOrCreateAppUser()` (`src/lib/current-app-user.ts`), on the first
   authenticated request — this is what actually drives the flow in this session, since
   there's no public URL for Clerk's webhook to reach in local dev.
2. Via `/api/webhooks/clerk` (svix-verified `user.created`/`user.updated`), as a backstop
   for production so the `users` row exists even if the very first click after signup
   somehow doesn't hit the app.

`student_profiles` is created via the onboarding grade-selection screen
(`src/app/onboarding`), not automatically — a user isn't a "student" with a grade until
they've picked one.

## Feature flags

`PAYWALL_ENABLED` (`src/lib/config.ts`, backed by the `PAYWALL_ENABLED` env var) defaults to
`false`. The `subscriptions` table exists in the schema but nothing reads or writes it yet —
no Stripe integration in this phase. When the paywall work starts, entitlement checks should
gate on this flag rather than on the mere existence of a `subscriptions` row, so flipping it
on later is a config change, not a code change.

## Quiz-taking flow

`src/lib/quiz.ts` holds the actual business logic (listing sub-topics, serving a quiz,
grading + persisting an attempt, recalculating mastery) as plain functions, independent of
any route — both the UI pages and `GET /api/sub-topics/[subTopicId]/quiz` call into the same
functions rather than the pages fetching from their own API route over HTTP. That route
handler exists as a standalone, directly-testable "quiz-serving endpoint" (per spec section
5) for API completeness/future clients, even though the server-rendered quiz page doesn't
need to call it over the network to render itself.

- Quiz length is capped at `QUIZ_LENGTH = 10` (`src/lib/quiz.ts`); sub-topics with fewer
  published MCQs just serve everything they have.
- Grading always re-fetches the answer key server-side from `mcqs.correct_option` — the
  client only ever sees `options`, never `correct_option`.
- Mastery is the **most recent attempt's score** for that sub-topic (not a rolling
  average) — simplest rules-based reading of spec section 5 for MVP. Thresholds: `< 60` =
  `needs_work`, `60–79` = `in_progress` (not called out explicitly in the spec's two-bucket
  example; added as a third tier so 60-79% isn't mislabeled as "needs work"), `>= 80` =
  `mastered`.
- The quiz submit flow is a single Server Action + native HTML form (radios marked
  `required` for native "answer everything" validation) — no client-side JS/state needed,
  so there's no separate quiz Client Component.
- Placeholder MCQs (`src/db/seed.ts`, 10 questions under Grade 10 → "Types of Chemical
  Reactions") are prefixed `[PLACEHOLDER TEST CONTENT]` so they're never mistaken for
  reviewed content — see spec section 7 for the real review process.
- Integration coverage: `tests/quiz-flow.test.ts` (vitest) runs the full select
  sub-topic → serve quiz → submit → persisted attempt/answers/mastery loop against a
  dedicated `quizpath_test` database (schema pushed by `tests/global-setup.ts`); `npm test`
  runs it.

## Brand / design system

Navy + gold theme tokens live in `src/app/globals.css` under `@theme inline`
(`--color-navy-*`, `--color-gold-*`), giving Tailwind utilities like `bg-navy-900` and
`text-gold-400` site-wide. So far they're only applied to the public landing page
(`src/app/page.tsx`) and the sign-in page (`src/app/sign-in`), which share a
`<BrandPanel>` component (`src/components/brand-panel.tsx`) — the landing page renders it
full-width with a "Sign in with Google" CTA, the sign-in page renders it as the left half
of a split screen (hidden below the `lg` breakpoint). The dashboard/quiz pages still use
the original neutral zinc styling — retrofitting them to the new palette wasn't in scope
for this pass.

Sign-in is a custom flow (`src/components/google-sign-in-button.tsx`), not Clerk's
prebuilt `<SignIn>` widget — an explicit "Continue with Google" button (standard Google
logo, `useSignIn` from `@clerk/nextjs/legacy`, since the default `@clerk/nextjs` export in
this Clerk version is a newer signal-based API without `authenticateWithRedirect`) so
there's no ambiguity that Google is the only sign-in method, plus a line of text saying so
directly. `src/app/sign-in/sso-callback/page.tsx` (`<AuthenticateWithRedirectCallback>`)
completes the OAuth redirect Clerk needs, then forwards to `/` (`redirectUrlComplete`),
which is where the onboarding-vs-dashboard branch already lives.

The layout/color structure (split-screen navy marketing panel + white sign-in form) was
adapted from a reference screenshot of a different product's login page; the copy was
rewritten from scratch for QuizPath rather than reused.

## What's NOT built yet

The dashboard's "progress by sub-topic" and "completed quizzes" sections render real data
(they already queried `mastery_scores` / `quiz_attempts` directly), but per-question review
after a quiz, Stripe/Billing, and Facebook login are still out of scope — see
`docs/mvp-product-spec.md` section 9 for the week-by-week plan.
